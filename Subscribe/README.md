Subscribe is an AutoChimp sub folder that uses a php script that on-click subscribes and updates the consent merge_field to 'Express' in the Mailchimp master list for that
user. If a client adds a url that points to this "settings_template.php" in this script with the added query field of *|EMAIL|* from mailchimps campaign email send outs, the action
will be carried out accordingly. Below is the link you attach to your campaign email to add this script functionality:


MAILCHIMP LINK: <a href="http://your_server.net/subscribe/settings_template.php?email=*|EMAIL|*">I give Express Consent</a>
