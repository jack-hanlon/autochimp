MailChimp API Automation for CASL Consent Legislation

This Package contains two individual Functionalities.

<h1>Automate</h1>
Automate is an autochimp feature which scans through a MASTER list on Mailchimp and purges members whose CASL Consent has expired. It does this automatically via Cron Jobs.
<h1>Subscribe</h1>
Subscribe is the second autochimp feature which gives you a link that you can put in your MC Campaign emails, to set the users consent to Express and protect them from the operations completed by Automate.
