<h2>Automate</h2>
Automate is an autochimp feature which scans through a MASTER list on Mailchimp and purges members whose CASL Consent has expired. It does this automatically via Cron Jobs. Can handle lists of any size. Has been ran on client lists of 25,000+ people.
<h2>Subscribe</h2>
Subscribe is the second autochimp feature which gives you a link that you can put in your MC Campaign emails, to set the users consent to Express and protect them from the operations completed by Automate.
